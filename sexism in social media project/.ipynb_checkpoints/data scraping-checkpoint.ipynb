    "### Why reddit?\n",
    "Of course, the ideal option for my project was Instagram and comments under the photos. But there is a limit on requests. After several blocks and endless waiting, it was decided to switch to Reddit. The Reddit platform is one of the most accessible and programmer-oriented. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Is the data relevant? \n",
    "This question was the most important and was asked at every stage of the data search. In order for the posts to be selected impartially, it was decided to take them from **the top, without paying attention to the agreement / disagreement with the author.** \n",
    "\n",
    "But after this solution, several problems appeared: \n",
    "* men are practically not discussed \n",
    "* posts depend very much on gender (women are discussed more for appearance, men are discussed for scandalous behavior)\n",
    "\n",
    "It was decided to try **to select posts on more or less similar topics, but if it doesn't work out, consider it already part of the found sexism and don't worry about different content** "
